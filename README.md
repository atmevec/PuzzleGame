# PuzzleGame
This is a small ripoff puzzle game based on 2048. Mainly just in the concept phase using a lot of the original CSS.

The example puzzles text file contains a string (per line) that can be pasted into the index.html page to spawn a puzzle I have created.

The last example puzzle is a template to use in the editor to create a new puzzle I was last working on.

The editor.html page can be opened to create/edit existing puzzles. All of this is, again, very rough and barely error-checked.
